MTAnalytics intelligently pairs analytics with UIKit. It ties analytics to key UIKit concepts, like `UIViewController`s and creates a flowchart style layout for viewing Analytics data.

Setting up the example project:

1) Install Cocoapods

MTAnalytics uses Cocoapods to manage dependencies. Follow the instructions here to install: http://cocoapods.org/

2) Run `pod install`

3) Open the .xcworkspace file.
